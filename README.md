# SpaceInvaders
Space Invaders-esque game. Written for sophomore year coursework with a partner. Uses the Java GameWorld API.

# To Play
Use the keyboard to move left and right. Use the spacebar to shoot the incoming enemies!
You move onto the next round when you kill a certain amount of enemies. The game gets progressively harder.
It's mildly fun.
